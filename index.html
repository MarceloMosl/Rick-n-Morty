                        <h2>Rick Sanchez</h2>
                        <p> Rick Sanchez is one of the two eponymous characters and the main protagonist from the Adult
                            Swim animated television series Rick and Morty. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon and
                            voiced by the former, Sanchez is a misanthropic alcoholic scientist inspired by Christopher
                            Lloyd's Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown from Back to the Future and Reed Richards from Marvel Comics.
                            In September 2021, Lloyd portrayed Sanchez himself in a series of promotional interstitials
                            for the series. <br>

                        <h2>Morty Smith</h2>
                        <p> Mortimer "Morty" Smith is one of the titular characters, one of the five main characters and
                            the secondary protagonist of the American animated television series Rick and Morty. Created
                            by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Morty is an anxious 14-year-old based on Michael J. Fox's
                            Marty McFly from Back to the Future.[3] Known for his awkward, anxious, second-guessing, and
                            doubtful personality and low sense of self-esteem, the character has been well-received. He
                            is the good-natured and impressionable grandson of mad scientist Rick Sanchez, the son of
                            Jerry and Beth Smith, and the younger brother of Summer Smith, who can be easily
                            manipulated. <br>

                        <h2>Evil Morty</h2>

                        <p> This Morty is one of the many versions of Morty from across the multiverse, but unlike the
                            other he finally grew tired of the sociopathic and reckless behavior of the multi-verses
                            Ricks, becoming ruthless, highly intelligent Morty with intelligent and cunning rivaling
                            that of a Rick. Before its near-total destruction, Evil Morty served as the first Morty to
                            be democratically elected President of The Citadel, and had consolidated his power in a coup
                            by eliminating any disagreeable Ricks in the Shadow Council. He later used this rise to
                            power to fabricate an escape from the Central Finite Curve, killing many of the Ricks and
                            Mortys within The Citadel. Due to his previously mysterious nature, he was at the center of
                            various theories <br>
